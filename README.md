# Burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, for dine-in.  
  
Each burger for "Dine-In" also has a `Take Out` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

This app stores every burger in a database, whether for Dine-In or Take-Out.

This burger logger uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. MVC design patterns are utilized; with Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate HTML.
